- use annotations like @Not or @Correlation to add new matchers -> need a way to define annotation as matchers
- when i have @Not - it matches if NO match exists, should make sure it's not affected by SOME matches
- remove @GoodExample and replace it with @BadExample -> @BugExample (or problem example).
 put @Not for what was in the @GoodExample and not in the trigger



- TreeWrapper
- special matchers for code size and complexity
- VariableMatcher should be by default !?
- all definitions (class, method, variable/field, should create a "matching table") especially when calling methods of external types
