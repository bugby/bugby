- use annotations like @Not or @Correlation to add new matchers -> need a way to define annotation as matchers
- when i have @Not - it matches if NO match exists, should make sure it's not affected by SOME matches
- remove @GoodExample and replace it with @BadExample -> @BugExample (or problem example).
 put @Not for what was in the @GoodExample and not in the trigger
 
 for @Not for example
 
 public class Pattern {
 
 @Not
 public void hashCode(){
 }
 
 }
 
should not match

 public class Pattern {
 
 public void otherMethod(){
 }
 
 public void hashCode(){
 }
 
 }
 
 i.e. should not take only the first match -> match count = 0
