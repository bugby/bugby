- TreeWrapper
- special matchers for code size and complexity
- all definitions (class, method, variable/field, should create a "matching table") especially when calling methods of external types


----------------
MISSING
- AnnotationTree
- ArrayTypeTree
- TypeParameterTree
- WildcardTree
- handle inner types
- correlations
- handle pattern type assignments - like with variables
- handle method invocations of pattern types
